This directory contains data files that are packaged with Gremlin Server:

* `credentials.kryo` - This data file contains a sample graph built from the
link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#credentials-dsl[Credentials DSL] which contains two
users: `stephen/password` and `marko/rainbow-dash`. This file is meant to be used by the `gremlin-server-secure.yaml`
and `gremlin-server-rest-secure.yaml` configuration files to demonstrate basic authentication functions.
* `sample.kryo` - This data file contains a random sample graph generated from the `DistributionGenerator` in
`IoDataGenerateTest.shouldWriteSampleForGremlinServer()`. It can be configured for use in Gremlin Server by using the
`load-sample.groovy` server initialization script file packaged with Gremlin Server. This graph has 10,000 vertices
and approximately 100,000 edges (using a "knows" label).
